# SpacePirates
Space shooter with voxel building written in JavaScript and the WebSocket server is written in Java

This repo is a copy of my SpaceShooter project I developed using subversion.
I decided to not include the all the subversion history.
It is too much work and I am not sure I see the value of having it.
It would however show the history of how and why the WebGL engine [ChronosGL](https://github.com/rhulha/ChronosGL) was born.
This was my first major WebGL project and I still love it.
It has taught me so so much!

I later rewrote everything using Dart. You can find that project here:
https://github.com/rhulha/SpacePiratesDart

It is however missing the enemy spaceship AI, the multiplayer and the block persistence. (I think)
